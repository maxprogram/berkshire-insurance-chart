### Chart created in D3

[Here's the actual chart in production](http://www.berkshireletters.com/). The design is fully responsive and graphics are retina-compatible.

All the javascript used to create the chart is in chart.js. It uses both [jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js) and [D3](http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js). jQuery is probably unecessary but I'm familiar with it so there you go.

Formatting is in both [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) which is easier to read and a compiled CSS for production use.
